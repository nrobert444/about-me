            <h2>Background info</h2>
            <p>I come from a film/tv background working across numerous departments. The area which most of my time was spent was set lighting which helps to determine the atmostphere and mood of the film. I stepped away from film to pursue a career that had less travel requirements and allowed me to spend more time at home with my family which is why i'm attending Alchemy code lab.</p>
